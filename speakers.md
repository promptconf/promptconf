## Short Talks

### Ahmed Jalloh

_Coding Out the Clink_

This talk is about the journey of a former incarcerated prisoner who went from Coding in the Clink to his transition on the outside, coding out the clink. What started as a program in 2009 at {REDACTED) Correctional Institute as the (REDACTED) with a few old Pentium 3 machines peaked the interest of not just men inside, but also volunteers and community members beyond the scope and purpose for which the program was intended. This collaboration between prisoners and IT tech professionals led to our prison conference know as (REDACTED). With such programing like this who needs prisons, after part of your rehabilitation brings a skill set thatâ€™s very much in demand and could possibly make you a living! The majority of prisons are inadequate in programing and resources. And while the (REDACTED) provided a valuable skill set that men could take to college or possibly use on the outside, prisoners are still faced with barriers to employment. This talk will present personal experience navigating this nontraditional route to a difficult modern industry.
