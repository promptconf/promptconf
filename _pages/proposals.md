# Call for Proposals

The inspiration  for our submission process came from the RubyConf process, and their CFP informed the structure and wording of ours! Thanks you RubyConf team. 

Thank you for your interest in speaking at **PromptConf**! The conference is **September 28** in Chicago.

If you have questions about any of these guidelines please first [read our FAQ]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ '/#faq' }}). If you find you still have a question you can reach us at [program@promptconf.com](mailto:program@promptconf.com).

## What should my talk be about?

We're throwing this conference to celebrate the joy and excitement of programming.

We want to hear about the discovery you’ve made that you cannot wait to tell all your friends about. Need motivation? Here’s some ideas!

- Tell us why you think cypher is the query language of the future. 
- Take us through the dramatic and intriguing story of Android’s nullColumnHack.
- Talk about how CSS Grid changed your life.
- Tell us about your spike on using Swift extensions to replace to the Massive View Controller once - and for all. 

We’ll assemble about 150 equally excitable colleagues who can’t wait to hear your amazing story.

We require all selected talks to comply wholly with our [Code of Conduct](conduct.html). If you have any questions about the suitability of your talk, email us at [program@promptconf.com](mailto:program@promptconf.com).

## What’s the proposal process?

Talks should be 10 minutes long.

Proposals can be submitted through **6/19**. We will accept talks on a rolling basis: the earlier you submit, the more likely you are to receive feedback on how to amend your proposal, which betters your ultimate odds of acceptance. We plan to have every proposal accepted, waitlisted, or declined by **7/10**.

### Are you a first time speaker? 

FANTASTIC! We’d love to have you. We’re happy to provide feedback on your proposal through the submission deadline, and if we accept your talk, we’ll provide you with a speaker mentor (See “Speaker Benefits” for more information on this).

## About the Review Process

Proposals will go through two rounds of evaluation. The first-round review will be **anonymized** — reviewers do not have access to your information, only what is in your proposal, to keep basic biases out of our calculations. **Please respect this process by keeping your biographical information out of the proposal itself.**
