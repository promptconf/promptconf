# Sponsorship

Prompt Conf is a brand new single track polyglot conference taking place on September 28, 2019 at the ActiveCampaign office in downtown Chicago. This year’s theme is the joy of computing! 

As a proud Chicago-focused conference, Prompt Conf has made two intentional decisions to make the conference as inclusive as possible. First, talks will be only 10 minutes long. Second, conference tickets will be kept at a low, accessible price point. 

## Call for Sponsors

By sponsoring Prompt Conf, you and your organization have the opportunity to join an event dedicated to celebrating the diverse talent in Chicago tech.
