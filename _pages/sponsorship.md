# Sponsorship

Prompt Conf is a brand new single track polyglot conference taking place on September 28, 2019 at ActiveCampaign’s office in downtown Chicago. This year’s theme will be focused on the joy of computing! 

As a proud Chicago focused conference, Prompt Conf has made two intentional decisions to make the conference as inclusive as possible. First, talks will be only 10 minutes long. Second, conference tickets will be kept at a low, accessible price point.
